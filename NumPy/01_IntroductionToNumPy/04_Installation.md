To install NumPy, you can use Python's package manager, pip. Here's how to do it:

1. **Install NumPy using pip:**

Open your command line interface (CLI) or terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install numpy
```

This command will download and install the latest version of NumPy from the Python Package Index (PyPI) along with any dependencies.

2. **Verify the installation:**

After the installation is complete, you can verify that NumPy is installed correctly by opening a Python interpreter and importing NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
print(np.__version__)
```

This code will import NumPy and print its version number. If no errors occur, it means NumPy is installed correctly.

3. **Upgrade NumPy (optional):**

If you already have NumPy installed but want to upgrade to the latest version, you can use the following command:

```
pip install --upgrade numpy
```

This command will upgrade NumPy to the latest version available on PyPI.

That's it! NumPy should now be installed on your system, and you can start using it for numerical computing tasks in Python.
